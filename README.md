# Godel Interviews

## Notes
1. Feel free to install anything you want. Please note, the app utilizes `pnpm` instead of `npm`.
2. Feel free to google anything you want, but aware the interviewer about that. Please, don't use AI tools during the interview.
3. If you have any questions about the task, feel free to ask an interviewer.
4. Thinking out loud is welcome. It helps an interviewer the way you do the task.
5. Completed task is not the main goal. We keen to understand the way you think.
